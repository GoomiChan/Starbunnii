[Starbunni]
==========================
Starbunii is a server wrapper for the Starbound server designed to be expanded easily with addons.
It's sorta like Bucket but for Starbound.

[Tech]
==========================
Starbunii is base on Node.js, that may seem like an odd choice and well I guess that is true. But this does have its
benefits, like the ability to leverage all of the modules for node, easy web panel interfacing and ease of addon
devolpment for the server :D

[Installation]
==========================
TODO:
Pretty much it will jsut be set up node on your server, run this and sleep :>

[Other]
